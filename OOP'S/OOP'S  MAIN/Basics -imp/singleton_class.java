public class singleton_class {
   // singleton class - when you want only one object or instance in you class.You can change its value in further program but no new otther object is created.
   // in singleton class you allow user to create new obj. but a backen you change the obj1, no new object is created.(garbage collection works here)
}
/*
 Object:

An instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the class definition, with its own set of values for the variables (properties) defined in the class.
Imagine each cookie you bake using the cookie cutter as a separate object.
Instance:

Another term for an object. It emphasizes that the object is a specific example of a class.
You can say "create an instance" or "create an object" of a class, both mean the same thing.
